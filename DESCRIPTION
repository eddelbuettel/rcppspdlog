Description: The mature and widely-used C++ logging library 'spdlog' by Gabi Melman provides
 many desirable features. This package bundles these header files for easy use by R packages
 from both their R and C or C++ code. Explicit use via 'LinkingTo:' is also supported. Also
 see the 'spdl' package which enhanced this package with a consistent R and C++ interface.
